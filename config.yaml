    content: |-
      I am an Associate Professor at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná (UTFPR), Brazil, where I teach software engineering and distributed programming.
      I am one of the leaders of the IntelAgir research group and work on multiple research and innovation projects. 
      I hold a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from IMT Atlantique, Nantes, France, and have pursued international experience through 
      postdoctoral research in Amsterdam (S2 Group, VU Amsterdam), Stuttgart (ICM, University of Stuttgart), and Porto (INESC TEC, University of Porto). 
      Currently, I am also leading the Computer Science/Informatics Department at the campus Francisco Beltrão.

      My research focuses on software engineering for cybernetic systems, including robotics and IoT, particularly interested in industrial robotics and collaborative 
      projects using the Robotic Operating System (ROS).

          Thesis: ***Controlling Cloud-based Systems for Elasticity Testing***
            - The main goal of testing elastic CBS is to verify how the system works in the presence of elasticity. 
            More specifically, testers may need to test CBS throughout a preset elastic behavior.
            For instance, one could need to test a CBS by interleaving resource scale out and in, which should reproduce most of CBS adaptations. 
            Since elasticity controllers react to variations in the workload, to drive the CBS, tests must lead workload variations that result in the preset elastic behavior. 
            However, this faces a challenge in estimating the workload variations. 
            Indeed, the effect of a workload depends on the CBS and the resource that hosts it. 
            Therefore, the CBS driving depends on profiling the effects of the workload on the CBS, and then, calculating and generating the workload variations.
